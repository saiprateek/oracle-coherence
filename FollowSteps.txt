Caches are hosted on a Coherence cluster. At run time, any JVM process that is running Coherence automatically joins the cluster and 
can access the caches and other services provided by the cluster. 

When a JVM joins the cluster, it is called a cluster node, or alternatively, a cluster member. 
For the sample applications in this chapter, two separate Java processes form the cluster: a cache server process and 
the Hello World application process. For simplicity, the two processes are collocated on a single machine. 
The cache server, by default, is configured to store cache data.



Steps to create a hello world application using Oracle coherence :

Step 1:  Create a maven web application . We need two configuration files to configure the coherence

i) example-config.xml  : To access the distributed coherence cache service.

ii) tangosol-coherence-override.xml : To configure the distribute coherence cache service on cluster. As I have earlier mentioned that coherence  cache mount on coherence cluster, So we need an address and port on system to run cache service.

 

Step 2:   Download and put coherence.jar in lib/ classpath

 

Step 3: Create example-config.xml in WEB-INF folder

Step 4:  Create tangosol-coherence-override.xml 

Step 5: Start your cache server by command : Open command prompt put command

java -cp COHERENCE_HOME\lib\coherence.jar;COHERENCE_HOME\config com.tangosol.net.DefaultCacheServer

Note: (put your coherence.jar accordingly in given folder like for me its in lib folder.
Example: So i will go to cmd project location -
C:\workspace\coherence-tests\src\java\main\webapp\WEB-INF\lib> java -cp coherence.jar;COHERENCE_HOME\config com.tangosol.net.DefaultCacheServer) 
and server will be started.




Happy learning.
